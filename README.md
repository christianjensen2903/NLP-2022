## About
Question answering is a key task of NLP. The most common way to approach this problem is with so called span selection. However this only allows for a single answer whereas the actual answer may be contained in multiple spans together. This project therefore looks at using a IOB-tagging system to classify the what parts of the text answer the given question if there is any answer.

## Key Features
